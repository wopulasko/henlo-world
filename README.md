# Hello World (Colored)

This repository contains a minimal Python program that prints "Hello world" with each word in a different color.

What it does
- Prints "Hello" in red and "world" in green using ANSI escape codes.

Usage
```bash
python hello.py
```

Notes
- The script uses ANSI escape sequences for color. Most UNIX-like terminals (Linux, macOS) and modern Windows terminals (Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7+) support these sequences.
- If you need cross-platform support on older Windows systems, consider using the colorama package:
```bash
pip install colorama
```
and change the script to initialize colorama at startup.

If you'd like, I will now commit this README.md to the main branch. Proceed to commit README.md? (If you prefer, I can instead open a PR, add a license, or include a .gitignore.)
