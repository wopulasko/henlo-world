# Hello World

This repository contains a minimal Python program that prints "Hello world" with each word in a different color.

Files:
- hello.py â€” prints Hello (red) and world (green) using ANSI escape codes.

Usage:

```bash
python hello.py
```

Notes:
- Colors use ANSI escape codes. Most Unix terminals and Windows Terminal support them.
- On some Windows setups you may need to install colorama: `pip install colorama` and run a colorama-enabled version of the script.
